# **Titanic Survival Prediction**
To build a machine learning model to predict Titanic passenger survival based on features like age, gender, ticket class, and fare. The process involves handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical data. The model should be evaluated using metrics like accuracy and precision. The final deliverable is a well-structured GitHub repository containing the code, preprocessing steps, model selection, and performance analysis.

# **Movie Rating Prediction**
It preprocesses data by handling missing values, converting numerical fields, and encoding categorical variables. Feature engineering includes calculating the director’s success rate and the average rating of similar movies by genre. The model, trained using a Random Forest Regressor, is evaluated using RMSE and R² scores. The dataset is split into training and testing sets to ensure robust performance. Finally, the trained model is saved as a .pkl file for future use. This structured approach enhances predictive accuracy and ensures data-driven insights.

# **Iris Flower Classification**
This project develops a machine learning model to classify Iris flowers into three species using sepal and petal measurements. The dataset undergoes preprocessing, including encoding categorical labels, feature standardization, and dataset splitting. A RandomForestClassifier is trained due to its efficiency and interpretability. Model evaluation is performed using accuracy score, classification report, and confusion matrix. Additionally, feature importance analysis identifies petal length and petal width as the most influential features. The final model achieves high accuracy, confirming its reliability for species classification. The GitHub repository includes structured code, preprocessing steps, feature importance visualization, and model evaluation results, ensuring reproducibility.

# **Sales Prediction**
This project develops a machine learning model to forecast product sales using historical data. It analyzes advertising spend, promotions, and customer segmentation while handling missing values, outliers, and feature scaling. The model is evaluated for accuracy, optimizing marketing strategies. A structured GitHub repository documents the methodology.

# **Credit Card Fraud Detection**
Develop a classification model to efficiently detect fraudulent credit card transactions. The dataset includes transaction details such as amount, merchant information, and timestamps. To handle class imbalance, techniques like oversampling, undersampling, or synthetic data generation will be used.
